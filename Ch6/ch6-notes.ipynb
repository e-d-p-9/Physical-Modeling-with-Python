Define once, and reuse often.\n\nIn the context of parameters (fixed quantities), this means you should define a parameter's value just once at the start of your code and refer to it by name througout the rest of the program.  But code itself can contain duplications if we wish to do the same (or nearly the same) task many times.  Just as with parameter values, you may later realize that something needs to be changed in your code.  Changing every instance of a recurring code fragment can be tedious and prone to error.  It is better to define a function once, then invoke it whenever needed.  You may even use the saem fragment of code inmore than one of your scripts.  If each script imports the same externally defined function, then changes that you make once in the function file will apply to all of your scripts.\n     Functions in python can do almost anything.  There are entire libraries of functions that can carry out mathematical operations, make plots, read and write files, and much more.  Your own functions can do all of these things as well.  Functions are ideal for writing code once and reusing it often.\n\n\n### 6.1.1 Defining functions in Python\n\nA function can be defined at the command prompt or in a file.  The following example is a basic template for creating a function in Python:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# excerpt from measurements.py\ndef taxicab(pointA, pointB):\n    \"\"\"\n    Taxicab metric for computing distance between points A and B.\n        pointA = (x1, y1)\n        pointB = (x2, y2)\n    Returns |x2-x1| + |y2-y1|.  Distances are measured in city blocks.\n    \"\"\"\n    interval = abs(pointB[0] - pointA[0]) + abs(pointB[1] - pointA[1])\n    return interval\n\n\ntaxicab([2.8, 5.1], [3.3, 4.4])","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":1,"data":{"text/plain":"1.1999999999999993"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The \"taxicab metric\" determines the billable distance between points \"as the cab drives\" rather than \"as the crow flies.\" . (That is, we use the total distance driven rather than the shortest straight line distance between the two points.)\n    The function consists of the following elements:\n\n<b>Declaration:</b>  The keyword ```def``` tells python you are about to define a function.  Function names must adhere to the same rules as variable names.  (See section 1.4.3) . It is wise to give your functions descriptive names.  Remember: You will only have to define it once, but you will wish to reuse it often.  Now is not the time to save typing by giving it a forgettable name like f.\n\n<b>Arguments:</b>  The name of the function is followed by the names of all its arguments:  the data it requires to do its calculation.  In this case, taxicab requires two arguments.  If it is called with only one argument or arguments of the wrong type,  Python will raise a TypeError exception.\n\n<b>Colon:</b>  The colon after the list of arguments begins an indented block of code associated with the function.  Notice the similarity with for and while loops and if statements.  Everything from the colon to the end of the code block will be executed when the function is called.\n\n<b>Docstrings:</b>  The text between the pair of triple-quotes (\"\"\"...\"\"\") is a docstring.  It is a special comment Python will use if someone asks for help on your function, and it is the standard place to describe what the function does and what arguments are required.  Python will not complain if you do not provide a docstring, but someone who uses your code might.\n\n<b>Body:</b>  The body of the function is the code that does something useful with the arguments.  This example is a simple function, so its body consists of just two lines.  More complicated functions can include loops, if statements, and calls to other functions, and may extend for many lines.\n\n<b>Return:</b>  In Python, a function always returns something to the program that invokes it.  If you do not specify a return value, Python will supply an object called None.  In this example, our function returns a float object.\n\n\nNow, let's look at how a function call works.

(See appendix F for details.)\n* Then, Python transfers control to taxicab.\n* When taxicab is finished, Python substitutes the return value into the assignment statement for trip_cost.\n* Python finishes evaluating the expression and assigns the answer to trip_cost.\n\nAlthough we defined start and stop as tuples in this example, we can call our new function with any objects that understand what thing[0] and thing[1] mean: lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Your turn 6A:\n\nDefine a function to compute the straight line distance between two points in three dimensional space.

It is a fragment of code that is executed upon request.  Unlike a script, a function is a Python object.  It can be called by name (once it is defined or imported), and it can be called by another script or function.  A function communicates with the calling program by way of its arguments and its return value.  After evaluating the functions, Python discards all of the function's local variables, so remember:\n\nIf a function performs a calculation, ```return``` the result.\n\nYou can define functions at the IPython command prompt.  However, if you plan to use a function more than once, you should save it in a file.  You can place a single function in its own file such as taxicab.py and run this file as a script prior to using the function.  (Running the file will define the function as if it had been entered at the command prompt.) . You can also define a function within the script that uses it, as long as its definition gets executed before the function is first called.\nIf you will be using the same functions in multiple scripts and interactive sessions, you can create a module in which you define one or more functions in a single .py file.  A module is a script that contains a collection of definitions and assignments.  It can be imported into your session from the command prompt, or by placing an ```import``` command within a script.  You can also import selectively, as described in Section 1.3.\nPlace taxicab and the function you wrote in Your Turn 6A (called, for example, crow) in a single file called measurements.py in your working directory.  Then, type ```import measurements``` you now have access to both functions under the names measurements.taxicab and measurements.crow.\nType help(measurements) and help(measurements.taxicab) to see how Python uses the docstrings you provide.  Note that if you give a module the same name as a function it contains, you still have to provide both the module and function name to Python.  For example, if you save the taxicab function in a file called taxicab.py and then import taxicab, calling taxicab(A,B) will result in an error.  To access the function, you must use taxicab.taxicab(A,B).\nModules that you write and wish to use should be located in the same folder as your main script, which is probably the global working directory you specified during setup.

We discuss some of these nuances in Appendix F. However, we strongly endorse the following guidelines for writing your own functions:\n\n1. Pass data to a function only through its arguments.\n2. Do not modify the arguments of a function\n3. Return the result of a calculation with a ```return``` statement.\n\nPython allows you to circumvent all of these conventions, but your code will be easier to write, interpret, and debug if you adhere to them.  Your functions will accept input (arguments) and produce output (a return value), without side effects.\nA side effect is any effect on the computer's satte other than returning a value.  Avoiding side effects is the cornerstone of functional programming.  Sometimes side effects are useful, but consider the alternatives when writing your own functions.\nUnintended side effects on arrays can be particularly troublesome.  Python does not automatically create a local copy of an array inside a function.  As a result, a function can modify the data in an array passed as an argument using array methods -- including assignment of individual elements.  (see section 2.2.6, page 26).  Array methods like x.sort() and x.fill(3), as well as in-place arithmetic like x+=1 and x*=2, can also modify array data.  Such side effects have the potential to speed up your code and reduce memory usage for operations on large arrays.  You can overwrite the array and modify its elements without making any copies.  However, this increase in performance comes at the cost of difficulty in debugging.\nIf you really do intend for a function to modify the elements of an array, you can still avoid side effects.  Create a local copy of the array within the function, operate on the copy, and return the new array.  Alternatively, you can create a placeholder array within the function, fill it with values, and return the arrays, with no effect on x.  If you wish, you can replace the original array with the new array returned by the function in the main code, rather than inside the function.\nThe following function illustrates these principles of functional programming:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# average.py\ndef running_average(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return cumulative average of an array.\n    \"\"\"\n    y = np.zeros(len(x))                    # new array to store results\n    current_sum = 0.0                       # running sum of elements on x\n    for i in range(len(x)):\n        current_sum += x[i]                 # increment sum\n        y[i] = current_sum / (i + 1.0)      # update running average\n    return y","execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The array being processed is passed as an argument.  This array is not modified; the result of the calculation is returned in a new array.\nIf you need the extra performance and reduced memory usage that come from overwritting an array, use the information in Appendix F to plan your code carefully and avoid unintended consequences.  However, try vectorizing your code using NumPy's efficient array operations before you resort to overwriting.\nVectorized code will amost always run faster than loops you write yourself in Python."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.2 Random Numbers and Simulation\n\nThere are many interesting problems in which we do not have complete knowledge of a system, but we do know the probabilities of the outcomes of simple events.  For example, you know the probability of any given outcome in the roll of a single die is 1/6, but do you know how likely it is that the sum of a roll of five dice is less than 13?  Rather than work out the combinatorics, you could roll five dice many times and determine the probability empirically.\nA random number generator makes it possible for a computer to \"roll dice\" millions of times per second.  Thus, you can use a random number generator to simulate a system described by a stochastic model in which the probability distributions of the parameters are known.  You can determine the likeyly behavbior of the system, even if you cannot work out the details analytically.  Such calculations are often called \"Monte Carlo simulations.\"\n\n### 6.2.1 Simulating coin flips\n\nThe simplest examples of a stochastic system is a coin flip.  Suppose that you want to simulate flipping a coin 100 times, record the number of heads or tails, and then repeat the whole series of 100 fips N times.  This will generate a set of N numbers, each falling in the range of 0 to 100, inclusive.\nHow do we get Python to flip the coin for us?

This works, but the default_rng approach uses an algorithm for generating random numbers that is more efficient and has better statistical properties.  Since we are going to be generating a lot of random numbers, we will use it from now on.\nTo make a series of independing flips, first create an array called samples that contains 100 random numbers generated by rand.  (Consult help(rand) for a clue about how to do this easily.)  You can then convert the random samples to a simulation of coin flips with flips=(samples<0.5).  Python evaluates the comparison item by item, and stores the result in flips.  You can then count the number of heads by using npsum(flips) or the array method flips.sum().
