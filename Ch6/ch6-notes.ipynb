    "In the context of parameters (fixed quantities), this means you should define a parameter's value just once at the start of your code and refer to it by name througout the rest of the program.  But code itself can contain duplications if we wish to do the same (or nearly the same) task many times.  Just as with parameter values, you may later realize that something needs to be changed in your code.  Changing every instance of a recurring code fragment can be tedious and prone to error.  It is better to define a function once, then invoke it whenever needed.  You may even use the saem fragment of code inmore than one of your scripts.  If each script imports the same externally defined function, then changes that you make once in the function file will apply to all of your scripts.\n",
    "     Functions in python can do almost anything.  There are entire libraries of functions that can carry out mathematical operations, make plots, read and write files, and much more.  Your own functions can do all of these things as well.  Functions are ideal for writing code once and reusing it often.\n",
