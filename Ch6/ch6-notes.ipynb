    "In the context of parameters (fixed quantities), this means you should define a parameter's value just once at the start of your code and refer to it by name througout the rest of the program.  But code itself can contain duplications if we wish to do the same (or nearly the same) task many times.  Just as with parameter values, you may later realize that something needs to be changed in your code.  Changing every instance of a recurring code fragment can be tedious and prone to error.  It is better to define a function once, then invoke it whenever needed.  You may even use the saem fragment of code inmore than one of your scripts.  If each script imports the same externally defined function, then changes that you make once in the function file will apply to all of your scripts.\n",
    "     Functions in python can do almost anything.  There are entire libraries of functions that can carry out mathematical operations, make plots, read and write files, and much more.  Your own functions can do all of these things as well.  Functions are ideal for writing code once and reusing it often.\n",

    "<b>Declaration:</b>  The keyword ```def``` tells python you are about to define a function.  Function names must adhere to the same rules as variable names.  (See section 1.4.3) . It is wise to give your functions descriptive names.  Remember: You will only have to define it once, but you will wish to reuse it often.  Now is not the time to save typing by giving it a forgettable name like f.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Arguments:</b>  The name of the function is followed by the names of all its arguments:  the data it requires to do its calculation.  In this case, taxicab requires two arguments.  If it is called with only one argument or arguments of the wrong type,  Python will raise a TypeError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Colon:</b>  The colon after the list of arguments begins an indented block of code associated with the function.  Notice the similarity with for and while loops and if statements.  Everything from the colon to the end of the code block will be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Docstrings:</b>  The text between the pair of triple-quotes (\"\"\"...\"\"\") is a docstring.  It is a special comment Python will use if someone asks for help on your function, and it is the standard place to describe what the function does and what arguments are required.  Python will not complain if you do not provide a docstring, but someone who uses your code might.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Body:</b>  The body of the function is the code that does something useful with the arguments.  This example is a simple function, so its body consists of just two lines.  More complicated functions can include loops, if statements, and calls to other functions, and may extend for many lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Return:</b>  In Python, a function always returns something to the program that invokes it.  If you do not specify a return value, Python will supply an object called None.  In this example, our function returns a float object.\n",

    "### 6.1.5 Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers programmers great flexibility in writing functions.  We discuss some of these nuances in Appendix F. However, we strongly endorse the following guidelines for writing your own functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass data to a function only through its arguments.\n",
    "2. Do not modify the arguments of a function\n",
    "3. Return the result of a calculation with a ```return``` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to circumvent all of these conventions, but your code will be easier to write, interpret, and debug if you adhere to them.  Your functions will accept input (arguments) and produce output (a return value), without side effects.\n",
    "A side effect is any effect on the computer's satte other than returning a value.  Avoiding side effects is the cornerstone of functional programming.  Sometimes side effects are useful, but consider the alternatives when writing your own functions.\n",
    "Unintended side effects on arrays can be particularly troublesome.  Python does not automatically create a local copy of an array inside a function.  As a result, a function can modify the data in an array passed as an argument using array methods -- including assignment of individual elements.  (see section 2.2.6, page 26).  Array methods like x.sort() and x.fill(3), as well as in-place arithmetic like x+=1 and x*=2, can also modify array data.  Such side effects have the potential to speed up your code and reduce memory usage for operations on large arrays.  You can overwrite the array and modify its elements without making any copies.  However, this increase in performance comes at the cost of difficulty in debugging.\n",
    "If you really do intend for a function to modify the elements of an array, you can still avoid side effects.  Create a local copy of the array within the function, operate on the copy, and return the new array.  Alternatively, you can create a placeholder array within the function, fill it with values, and return the arrays, with no effect on x.  If you wish, you can replace the original array with the new array returned by the function in the main code, rather than inside the function.\n",

    "There are many interesting problems in which we do not have complete knowledge of a system, but we do know the probabilities of the outcomes of simple events.  For example, you know the probability of any given outcome in the roll of a single die is 1/6, but do you know how likely it is that the sum of a roll of five dice is less than 13?  Rather than work out the combinatorics, you could roll five dice many times and determine the probability empirically.\n",

Thus, you can use a random number generator to simulate a system described by a stochastic model in which the probability distributions of the parameters are known.

    "The simplest examples of a stochastic system is a coin flip.  Suppose that you want to simulate flipping a coin 100 times, record the number of heads or tails, and then repeat the whole series of 100 fips N times.  This will generate a set of N numbers, each falling in the range of 0 to 100, inclusive.\n",
    "How do we get Python to flip the coin for us?  First, try typing 1 > 2 a the IPython console prompt, and then 2>1.  You'll see that Python returns a Boolean value of True or False when it evaluates each of these expressions."
